# Metrics (HAFI)

> HAFI does not measure "velocity"; it measures **decision quality** and **rework reduction**.

## Main metric (North Star)
- **NSM:** (define)

## Operational metrics
- **Rework rate:** # reopened nodes / # closed nodes
- **Time to real validation:** (hours or days)
- **Critical technical debt introduced:** (0 / 1 / n + detail)
- **Accumulated automations:** (list + estimated impact)
- **Initial node clarity:** (1–5; 5 = completely clear)

## Thresholds
- Acceptable rework: <= ___%
- Target time to validation: <= ___
- Critical technical debt: 0
